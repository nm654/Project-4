        <p>Despite all these things known about glaciers and achieved by them,
            it’s a bit difficult to believe that glaciers are disappearing at a dangerous and unprecedented rate.
            The cause for this is the increase of human industrial activities and subsequently the rise of carbon dioxide
            and gases known as the greenhouse gases, trapping the sun’s heat in a bubble known as the ozone layer. Since glacier
            ice reflects the sunlight, the sun energy gets trapped in the layer and reflected onto the glaciers.
            (In simple terms, but the truth is far more complex.) Rapidly
            increased heat from the sun due to being unable to completely escape Earth’s atmosphere
            has caused the world to increase it’s temperature (the phenomena known as global warming).</p>
        </article>
        <div class="card">
            <img class="card-img-top" src="images/dirt.jpeg" alt="Loss of almost everything">
            <h2 class="card-title">The Effects of Melting Glaciers</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            Changing glaciers changes the amount of water and the temperature from river runoff.
            Several species that rely on the runoff wouldn’t be able to handle the temperature change leading to death of sea species.
            This isn’t even factoring in the rapid increase of the ocean level from glaciers, which will have immeasurable effect
            on the oceans. Climate change would show in the changing weather from the water cycle which begins with the water
            and causes the different types of weather depending on how much is taken when it begins. There’s also the factor
            of that water being needed for people that rely on glaciers as well. Their loss would come from the different amount
            of water and rising levels of water means less land for them. Glaciers show that there’s a change happening,
            and people need to change their ways of life before the glaciers completely change.
